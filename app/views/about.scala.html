            <h3>What is Dog?</h3>
            <p class="about_text_p"> 
                Dog is a board game for 2 to 6 players. The game is like the classic German board game "Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht".
                In order to win you must bring your 4 game pieces to safety. The main difference is that the pieces are not moved with dices.
                They are moved with the help of cards.

            <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
            <p class="about_text_p">
                The game starts with the first player playing a card. Its effect is then executed. After playing a card the player does not get to draw a new card.
                Then the next player plays a card and so forth. When a player can not get a game piece out of home, he is not able to play this round. If all cards are used the round ends. 
            </p>
            <p class="about_text_p">
                In the next round each player gets new cards and another round is played. This pattern repeats itself until a player has moved all his game pieces into the garage.

            <h3>Cards:</h3>
            <p class="about_text_p">
                <ul class="about_list_1">
                    <li>The game is played with 15 different cards with the following effects:</li>
                    <li>The card play, 1, 11 and 13 can be used to get a game piece from home into the game. 1, 11 and 13 also move the piece 1 or 11 fields forward.</li>
                    <li>The card 4 can also be used to move backwards.</li>
                    <li>The swap card allows you to exchange one of your cards with one of your opponents.</li>
                    <li>The joker card can obtain one of the above card effects.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <p class="about_text_p">
                <ol class="about_list_2">
                    <li>Before a round starts each player gets a set number of cards. </li>
                    <li>Pieces are moved by the number on the card which is played. If a card with the value 5 is played the player can move a piece by 5 fields.
                        While moving all game pieces can be skipped, but their fields are counted.</li>
                    <li>There can only be one game piece on a field. When another game piece moves onto an occupied field, the occupying piece gets moved back to home.
                        Furthermore, all game pieces which are overtaken with the card 7 also must be moved back to home. </li>
                    <li>When a card is played you must move a piece by the provided number. When a player can move into the garage with a 5 but plays a 7, he must complete another round around the board.</li>
                    <li>Game pieces which have reached the garage can only be moved forward. Game pieces cannot be overtaken in the garage.</li>
                    <li>If a player has moved all his pieces into the garage, he has won the game.</li>
                </ol>
